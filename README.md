# ASPIRES
The Academic Skills, Planning, and Intentional Relationships for Engagement and Success Application (ASPIRIES) is a student-mentor task management app developed as part of a summer research project at Hope College.
The app was started as a senior capstone project in Spring 2025, and continued as a summer research project with the Computer Science Department.
It is designed to help incoming freshmen adjust to college life by providing a user interface for them to create and organize tasks, connections, and school resources.
Built using Flutter and Dart (frontend) and Java Spring Boot (backend), using API endpoints connecting the frontend to the backend, with a PostgreSQL database and AWS Pinpoint for managing notifications.
